Test driven approach using apachi POI
-------------------------------------

This is a small example that how we can implement test driven frame work using apachi POI

This app has simple login functionality (Eg: facebook login )

Using apachi POI api, we can interact with Excel sheets.

This program will get test sequence from excel, inputs from excel and store the output (PASS/FAIL) in to the same.

How to run this app
--------------------

1) Change the path of the excel sheet in ExcelUtils.java and Apache_POI_TC.java
2) Run the Apache_POI_TC jave and see the results populated in the same excel sheet.
